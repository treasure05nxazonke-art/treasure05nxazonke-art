👋 Hi, I'm Treasure Nxazonke (she/her)—a passionate frontend developer currently interning at Codevda Technologies!

💻 I specialize in building interactive user interfaces with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React**. My favorite projects include [Counter App](https://treasure05nxazonke-art.github.io/Counter-App/) and [Interactive Form](https://treasure05nxazonke-art.github.io/interactive-form/), where I enjoyed bringing ideas to life with code.

🎯 I believe learning is a step-by-step journey, and I'm dedicated to mastering modern frontend frameworks and libraries. Beyond coding, I'm focused on improving my English communication skills.

🍲 When I'm not programming, you'll find me savoring good food, watching series 🍿, or listening to music 🎶. I'm also a proud Seventh-day Adventist ✨.

🤝 Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/treasure-nxazonke-a20184370) to chat about tech, projects, or anything creative!
